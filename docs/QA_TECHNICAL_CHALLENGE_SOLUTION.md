## Test Case 1: Console Error Detection

### Objective
Detect and report JavaScript console errors and network failures using triple-strategy validation for maximum reliability.

### Approach
Implemented three complementary detection strategies:
1. **Strategy 1: Event Listeners** - Captures `console.error()` calls and unhandled exceptions
2. **Strategy 2: Network Monitoring** - Detects failed HTTP requests (4xx, 5xx status codes)
3. **Strategy 3: CDP + Performance API** - Uses Chrome DevTools Protocol (Chromium only) and Performance API

### Test Scenarios
- **Scenario 1:** Homepage validation (no errors expected)
- **Scenario 2:** About page validation (intentional 404 error - negative test)

### Results

#### Homepage Test (All Browsers)
```
✅ Chromium:      0 errors detected - PASS
✅ Firefox:       0 errors detected - PASS  
✅ Webkit:        0 errors detected - PASS
✅ Chrome:        0 errors detected - PASS
✅ Edge:          0 errors detected - PASS
```

**Verification:**
- All 3 strategies agreed: 0 errors
- No strategy disagreements
- Critical errors after filtering: 0

#### About Page Test (Intentional Error)
```
✅ All browsers correctly detected 404 error:
   - HTTP 404: https://pocketaces2.github.io/about.html
   - Console error: "Failed to load resource: 404"
```

### Key Features
- **Benign error filtering:** Automatically ignores harmless browser warnings
- **Triple verification:** Requires agreement across multiple detection methods
- **CDP integration:** Enhanced logging for Chromium-based browsers
- **Performance monitoring:** Tracks navigation timing issues

### Pass Rate: 100% (10/10 tests)

---

## Test Case 2: Link Status Code Verification

### Objective
Validate that all links on the homepage return successful HTTP status codes (200 or 3xx) using triple-strategy validation.

### Approach
Implemented three independent validation strategies:
1. **Strategy 1: Page Request API** - Uses Playwright's `page.request.get()` 
2. **Strategy 2: Page Navigation** - Full browser navigation with `page.goto()`
3. **Strategy 3: Browser Fetch API** - Native browser `fetch()` in page context

### Links Validated
1. Homepage: `https://pocketaces2.github.io/fashionhub/`
2. Account: `https://pocketaces2.github.io/fashionhub/account.html`
3. Products: `https://pocketaces2.github.io/fashionhub/products.html`
4. Cart: `https://pocketaces2.github.io/fashionhub/cart.html`
5. About: `https://pocketaces2.github.io/fashionhub/about.html`

### Results

#### All Browsers - Perfect Agreement

```
========================================
Strategy Comparison & Agreement Analysis
========================================

✅ All 5 links validated successfully
✅ All strategies returned 200 status codes
✅ 100% strategy agreement across all browsers
✅ 0 strategy disagreements
✅ 0 invalid links detected

Browser Results:
- Chromium:  5 links ✓ (6.9s)
- Firefox:   5 links ✓ (6.9s)
- Webkit:    5 links ✓ (7.7s)
- Chrome:    5 links ✓ (5.5s)
- Edge:      5 links ✓ (5.6s)
```

### Technical Highlights
- **Challenge solved:** Initial navigation to `/` landed on GitHub 404 page
- **Solution:** Changed to `page.goto(fullURL)` with explicit production URL
- **Link filtering:** Excludes assets (CSS, JS, images) - only validates HTML pages
- **Verification rigor:** All 3 strategies must agree for test to pass

### Pass Rate: 100% (5/5 tests)

## Test Case 4: GitHub Pull Request Scraper

### Objective
Scrape **ALL** open pull requests from GitHub's Appwrite repository with **automatic pagination** and generate CSV reports with triple-strategy verification.

### Enhancement: Full Pagination Implementation
**Scope Expansion:** Enhanced from single-page (25 PRs) to **complete multi-page scraping (233 PRs across 10 pages)**

### Approach
Implemented three independent scraping strategies with pagination:
1. **Strategy 1: DOM Query with Fallbacks** - Multiple selector attempts with defensive coding
2. **Strategy 2: Class-based Selectors** - Direct `.js-issue-row` class targeting
3. **Strategy 3: Playwright Locator API** - Uses Playwright's robust locator engine

**Pagination Logic:**
- Automatically detects total PR count from GitHub UI
- Calculates required pages (25 PRs per page)
- Traverses all pages until no more PRs found
- Smart detection stops when empty page encountered

### Data Extracted
- PR Title
- Author
- Created Date
- PR URL
- Verification Status (verified by x/3 strategies)

### Results

#### Successful Browsers (5/5 - 100%)

```
✅ Chromium:  233 PRs extracted across 10 pages, 100% verified by all 3 strategies

## Known Issues & Resolutions

### Issue 1: GitHub 404 Landing Page ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem:** Test Case 2 initially found 0 links  
**Root Cause:** Navigation to `/` landed on GitHub's 404 error page instead of Fashion Hub  
**Solution:** Changed from `page.goto('/')` to `page.goto(fullURL)` with explicit base URL  
**Result:** ✅ Fixed - All 5 links now validated successfully

### Issue 2: Test Case 4 Chrome Timeout ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem:** Chrome browser timed out waiting for GitHub page load  
**Root Cause:** `waitForLoadState('networkidle')` took >60 seconds on GitHub  
**Solution:** Changed to `waitForLoadState('domcontentloaded')` for faster, more reliable page load detection  
**Result:** ✅ Fixed - Chrome now passes in ~10 seconds, 100% pass rate achieved

### Triple-Strategy Validation Pattern

All test cases implement a robust triple-strategy validation pattern:

```typescript
// Example: Test Case 2 Link Validation
Strategy 1: page.request.get(link)         → HTTP status code
Strategy 2: page.goto(link)                → Navigation status
Strategy 3: browser fetch(link)            → Fetch API response

Result: ✅ PASS only if all 3 strategies agree
```

**Benefits:**
- **Higher confidence:** Multiple independent verification methods
- **Catch edge cases:** Different strategies may expose different issues  
- **Robustness:** If one strategy fails, others provide fallback
- **Evidence:** Clear reporting shows agreement/disagreement across strategies

### Test Architecture

## Accessibility Finding

During deep investigation of Test Case 1, an accessibility issue was identified:

**Finding:** Missing `<main>` landmark on Fashion Hub pages  
**Impact:** Screen reader users cannot quickly navigate to main content  
**Severity:** Medium (WCAG 2.1 Level A violation)  
**Recommendation:** Add `<main>` element wrapping primary content area  

### How to Reproduce

1. **Install Screen Reader Extension:**
   - Install "Screen Reader" extension in Chrome or use built-in screen reader (NVDA/JAWS on Windows, VoiceOver on Mac)
   
2. **Navigate to Fashion Hub:**
   - Open browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Wait for the homepage to load completely

3. **Inspect Page Structure:**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Elements/Inspector tab
   - Use Ctrl+F to search for `<main` tag in the HTML
   
4. **Verify Issue:**
   - **Expected:** Should find a `<main>` element wrapping the primary content
   - **Actual:** No `<main>` landmark element found in the DOM
   - Search also reveals no `role="main"` attribute on any container

5. **Test Screen Reader Navigation:**
   - Enable screen reader
   - Try using landmark navigation shortcuts (e.g., "D" key in NVDA/JAWS)
   - **Result:** Cannot jump directly to main content - only header, nav, footer landmarks available

### Console Output from Test Execution

When running Test Case 1 with the accessibility checks, the console output shows:

```bash
$ npx playwright test test-case-1-console-errors --grep="@accessibility"

Running 5 tests using 5 workers

  ✓  1 [chromium] › test-case-1-console-errors.spec.ts:accessibility checks (5.2s)
  ✓  2 [firefox] › test-case-1-console-errors.spec.ts:accessibility checks (4.8s)
  ✓  3 [webkit] › test-case-1-console-errors.spec.ts:accessibility checks (5.1s)
  ✓  4 [chrome] › test-case-1-console-errors.spec.ts:accessibility checks (5.3s)
  ✓  5 [edge] › test-case-1-console-errors.spec.ts:accessibility checks (5.0s)

  5 passed (26.4s)

=== Accessibility Analysis ===
Page: http://localhost:3000
Landmarks found: header, nav, footer
Missing landmarks: main ⚠️
WCAG 2.1 Level A violation detected
```

The test passes functionally but logs a warning about the missing `<main>` landmark, which is captured in the test report for manual review.

### Example Fix

```html
<body>
  <header>...</header>
  <main role="main">  <!-- Add this -->
    <!-- Page content -->
  </main>
  <footer>...</footer>
</body>
```
